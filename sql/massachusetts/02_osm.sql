-- Query 2: 
-- Purpose: The second query should summarize or aggregate results by an administrative unit or category.

-- Requirements:
-- - Use adminareas_a for counties (fclass = 'admin_level6')
-- - Use landuse_a for parks (fclass = 'park')
-- - Use ST_Intersects to join parks to counties
-- - Use ST_Intersection to clip park geometries to county boundaries
-- - Use ST_Area(geom::geography) for accurate measurements on WGS84
-- - Convert square meters to square kilometers (divide by 1,000,000)
-- - Group results by county name
-- - Include geom column for spatial visualization

-- Expected Output:
-- - county_name
-- - park_area_sq_km
-- - geom
